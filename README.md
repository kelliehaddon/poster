# Poster
This [poster](poster.pdf) is part of an assignment in my data analysis class (SIS 750) at the School of International Service at American University. The assignment was to ask and answer an empirical question using appropriate data and statistical analysis then presenting the work in a single poster in a way that is both sophisticated and understandable to a lay audience.

This presentation pulls from [data](qog_bas_cs_jan24.xlsx) published by Dahlberg et al. (2024) from the Quality of Government (QOG) Institute, pulling from a variety of publicly available datasets. In this poster I analyze the relationship between women's political empowerment and a country's level of peacefulness.

Also included in this repository is the [R Markdown](poster.Rmd) file used to create the poster.
